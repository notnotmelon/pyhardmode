[entity-description]
py-sinkhole=Send those fluids back to where they came. Must be placed on water.
py-gas-vent=Dispose unwanted gases into the atmosphere.
pydrive=Use giant, genetically modified worms to transport large quantities of materials underground. To enable the transfer of items between input and output copies, they must have the same cloud ID. Requires 200MW.
nuclear-reactor=Generates waste heat that must be removed.
py-burner=Burns logs, trees, and biomass into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk01=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk02=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk03=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
py-coal-powerplant-mk04=Advanced plant to convert the good ol' coal into heat.
rtg=Great use of isotopes to generate huge heat.

[item-description]
macguffin=Caution! Realism alert! You are overthinking again, please remain calm and enjoy the game.
sweater=It's a sweater. It's warm and cozy. It's also a bit itchy. Become immune to all damage.

[pywiki-descriptions]
beacon=The [entity=beacon-AM1-FM1] and [entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1] use radio signals to trasmit module effects into nearby assembling machines. Each beacon has both an AM and an FM frequency that determines the effect radius, transmission efficiency, and power usage.\nThe AM and FM frequency sliders range from 1-5.\n\n[entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 32\n    - AM2: 24\n    - AM3: 16\n    - AM4: 8\n    - AM5: 2\nTransmission efficiency: 0.1 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) / 2 MW\n\n[entity=beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 64\n    - AM2: 48\n    - AM3: 32\n    - AM4: 16\n    - AM5: 2\nTransmission efficiency: 0.2 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) MW\n\nThe default 1AM 1FM beacon is wide area low power.\nIf two beacons have the same AM:FM frequencies, the signals will interfere and cancel each other out.\nBeacons do not accept productivity modules such as [item=productivity-module-3].
vatbrain=Sometimes science pushes too far. [entity=vat-brain] grants a large productivity bonus to nearby [entity=lab] at a high cost.\n\n[entity=vat-brain] works similarly to the [entity=beacon], however it must be fed constantly with cartridges such as [item=brain-cartridge-01]. A single cartridge will last for 20 seconds.\nThe effect of multiple vatbrains can stack together, granting a greater productivity bonus. Whenever the cartridge expires, you will lose the productivity bonus.\n\nEach cartridge grants a different amount of productivity to nearby labs:\n- [item=brain-cartridge-01] → 15%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-02] → 30%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-03] → 45%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-04] → 60%
pydrive=You’ve created a species of giant, super fast, yet docile worms. They are able to transfer items instantaneously between different [entity=pydrive] buildings, as long as those buildings are tuned to the identification of the same worm.\n\nUse the rings of checkboxes to select a specific worm - every pattern of checked and unchecked boxes will select a different worm. Your items will still be with the worm if no logistic station is tuned to that worm, you can retrieve them by tuning to that worm again.\n\n[entity=pydrive] requires 200MW of continuous electricity.

minimum-temperature=Required temperature

[technology-name]
py-burner=Heat pipes
sweater=Sweater

[technology-description]
py-burner=Technologies for the transfer of heat over distance. Heat pipes have a decay of 2°C per tile. You cannot lose energy. This only effects the max length heat can travel.
simik-mk01=Exotic animals that are adapted for life in extreme temperatures.
