[item-description]
macguffin=Caution! Realism alert! You are overthinking again, please remain calm and enjoy the game.
sweater=It's a sweater. It's warm and cozy. It's also a bit itchy. Become immune to all damage.
biocarnation=A strange hybrid growth of various fungi. Perhaps this could be harvested in the [entity=fwf-mk01].
biocrud=Slimy, sticky, and smelly byproduct of biological processes. It can be reprocessed into useful materials.
rich-biocrud=Unfortunate result from spoiling expensive biomaterials. It can be reprocessed.
floraspollinin=The result of [item=native-flora] overripening. Can be pruned to revert the flora to an earlier stage in the harvest cycle. 

[pywiki-descriptions]
beacon=The [entity=beacon-AM1-FM1] and [entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1] use radio signals to trasmit module effects into nearby assembling machines. Each beacon has both an AM and an FM frequency that determines the effect radius, transmission efficiency, and power usage.\nThe AM and FM frequency sliders range from 1-5.\n\n[entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 32\n    - AM2: 24\n    - AM3: 16\n    - AM4: 8\n    - AM5: 2\nTransmission efficiency: 0.1 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) / 2 MW\n\n[entity=beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 64\n    - AM2: 48\n    - AM3: 32\n    - AM4: 16\n    - AM5: 2\nTransmission efficiency: 0.2 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) MW\n\nThe default 1AM 1FM beacon is wide area low power.\nIf two beacons have the same AM:FM frequencies, the signals will interfere and cancel each other out.\nBeacons do not accept productivity modules such as [item=productivity-module-3].
vatbrain=Sometimes science pushes too far. [entity=vat-brain] grants a large productivity bonus to nearby [entity=lab] at a high cost.\n\n[entity=vat-brain] works similarly to the [entity=beacon], however it must be fed constantly with cartridges such as [item=brain-cartridge-01]. A single cartridge will last for 20 seconds.\nThe effect of multiple vatbrains can stack together, granting a greater productivity bonus. Whenever the cartridge expires, you will lose the productivity bonus.\n\nEach cartridge grants a different amount of productivity to nearby labs:\n- [item=brain-cartridge-01] → 15%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-02] → 30%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-03] → 45%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-04] → 60%
pydrive=You’ve created a species of giant, super fast, yet docile worms. They are able to transfer items instantaneously between different [entity=pydrive] buildings, as long as those buildings are tuned to the identification of the same worm.\n\nUse the rings of checkboxes to select a specific worm - every pattern of checked and unchecked boxes will select a different worm. Your items will still be with the worm if no logistic station is tuned to that worm, you can retrieve them by tuning to that worm again.\n\n[entity=pydrive] requires 200MW of continuous electricity.
