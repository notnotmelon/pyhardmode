beacon=The [entity=beacon-AM1-FM1] and [entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1] use radio signals to trasmit module effects into nearby assembling machines. Each beacon has both an AM and an FM frequency that determines the effect radius, transmission efficiency, and power usage.\nThe AM and FM frequency sliders range from 1-5.\n\n[entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 32\n    - AM2: 24\n    - AM3: 16\n    - AM4: 8\n    - AM5: 2\nTransmission efficiency: 0.1 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) / 2 MW\n\n[entity=beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 64\n    - AM2: 48\n    - AM3: 32\n    - AM4: 16\n    - AM5: 2\nTransmission efficiency: 0.2 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) MW\n\nThe default 1AM 1FM beacon is wide area low power.\nIf two beacons have the same AM:FM frequencies, the signals will interfere and cancel each other out.\nBeacons do not accept productivity modules such as [item=productivity-module-3].
pydrive=You’ve created a species of giant, super fast, yet docile worms. They are able to transfer items instantaneously between different [entity=pydrive] buildings, as long as those buildings are tuned to the identification of the same worm.\n\nUse the rings of checkboxes to select a specific worm - every pattern of checked and unchecked boxes will select a different worm. Your items will still be with the worm if no logistic station is tuned to that worm, you can retrieve them by tuning to that worm again.\n\n[entity=pydrive] requires 200MW of continuous electricity.

minimum-temperature=Required temperature

[technology-name]
py-burner=Heat pipes
sweater=Sweater

[technology-description]
py-burner=Technologies for the transfer of heat over distance. Heat pipes have a decay of 2°C per tile. You cannot lose energy. This only effects the max length heat can travel.
simik-mk01=Exotic animals that are adapted for life in extreme temperatures.

pyhm-resource-rocks-disallow-building-over=Disallow building non-miner structures over resource rocks
pyhm-resource-rocks-infinite=Infinite resource rocks

[mod-setting-description]
pyhm-decrease-containers-inventory-size=Decreases regular and logistic containers' inventory size.\n[entity=wooden-chest]: 16 -> 4\n[entity=iron-chest]: 32 -> 8\n[entity=steel-chest]: 48 -> 20\n[entity=py-shed-basic]: 75 -> 40\n[entity=py-storehouse-basic]: 150 -> 80\n[entity=py-warehouse-basic]: 450 -> 120\n[entity=py-deposit-basic]: 800 -> 160
pyhm-replace-sinkhole-with-outfall=Changes __ENTITY__py-sinkhole__ to __ENTITY__pyhm-outfall__. __ENTITY__pyhm-outfall__ needs to be placed over the water.
pyhm-resource-rocks-disallow-building-over=With this option enabled you won't be able to build structures other than mines over resource rocks such as [entity=iron-rock]__ENTITY__iron-rock__.\n\n"You shall not build belts nor rails over boulders".

[cant-build-reason]
mining-with-fluid-not-available=Usage of fluid in mining drills not researched.
