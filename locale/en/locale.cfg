[entity-description]
py-sinkhole=Send those fluids back to where they came. Must be placed on water.
py-gas-vent=Dispose unwanted gases into the atmosphere.
pydrive=Use giant, genetically modified worms to transport large quantities of materials underground. To enable the transfer of items between input and output copies, they must have the same cloud ID. Requires 200MW.
nuclear-reactor=Generates waste heat that must be removed.

[fluid-name]
purest-nitrogen-gas=Contaminated nitrogen

[recipe-name]
fractional-distillation=Fractional distillation
vacuum-void=Vacuum depressurization
pressured-air-void=Air depressurization

[recipe-description]
fractional-distillation=Decompose environmental compounds according to small differences in their boiling points. Only a fraction of pure nitrogen can be recovered.

[item-name]
dried-meat=Jerky
macguffin=Nexelit-titanium-kevlar-aramid-tritium-unobtanium superpolymer nanowoven biocomposite smart self-healing quantum N-dimensional hyperfabric
quantum-simulation-data=Quantum simulation data
sweater=Sweater
carbon-monoxide=Carbon monoxide
rough-carbon-dust=Rough Carbon Dust

[item-description]
macguffin=Caution! Realism alert! You are overthinking again, please remain calm and enjoy the game.
sweater=It's a sweater. It's warm and cozy. It's also a bit itchy. Click anywhere on the map to teleport. Become immune to all damage.
rough-carbon-dust=Bits and pieces of raw carbon. Can be burned.

[pywiki-descriptions]
beacon=The [entity=beacon-AM1-FM1] and [entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1] use radio signals to trasmit module effects into nearby assembling machines. Each beacon has both an AM and an FM frequency that determines the effect radius, trasmission efficiency, and power usage.\nThe AM and FM frequency sliders range from 1-5.\n\n[entity=diet-beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 32\n    - AM2: 24\n    - AM3: 16\n    - AM4: 8\n    - AM5: 2\nTrasmission efficiency: 0.1 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) / 2 MW\n\n[entity=beacon-AM1-FM1]\nEffect radius:\n    - AM1: 64\n    - AM2: 48\n    - AM3: 32\n    - AM4: 16\n    - AM5: 2\nTrasmission efficiency: 0.2 * AM * FM\nPower consumption: AM * (FM ^ 3) MW\n\nThe default 1AM 1FM beacon is wide area low power.\nIf two beacons have the same AM:FM frequencies, the signals will interfere and cancel each other out.\nBeacons do not accept productivity modules such as [item=productivity-module-3].
vatbrain=Sometimes science pushes too far. [entity=vat-brain] grants a large productivity bonus to nearby [entity=lab] at a high cost.\n\n[entity=vat-brain] works similarly to the [entity=beacon], however it must be fed constantly with cartridges such as [item=brain-cartridge-01]. A single cartridge will last for 20 seconds.\nThe effect of multiple vatbrains can stack together, granting a greater productivity bonus. Whenever the cartridge expires, you will lose the productivity bonus.\n\nEach cartridge grants a different amount of productivity to nearby labs:\n- [item=brain-cartridge-01] → 15%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-02] → 30%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-03] → 45%\n- [item=brain-cartridge-04] → 60%

[technology-name]
py-burner=Heat pipes
sweater=Sweater

[technology-description]
py-burner=Technologies for the transfer of heat over distance. Heat pipes have a decay of 2°C per tile. You cannot lose energy. this only effects the max length heat can travel.
simik-mk01=Exotic animals that are adapted for life in extreme temperatures.
