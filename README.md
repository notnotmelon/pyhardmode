### Pyanodons Hard Mode

Pyanodons Hard Mode is an extension to [Pyanodons Alternative Energy](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pyalternativeenergy) focused on making the whole modpack more difficult (but hopefully still fun). Unlike other pY mods, this mod doesn't add any new items. Instead, Pyanodons Hard Mode is focused on adding new & difficult mechanics. Perfect for masochists, lunatics, and psychos.

### Waste Processing

- The sinkhole, gas vent, and burner have been severely nerfed or reworked. Voiding items is now much more difficult.
- Sinkhole can only void water and it must be placed on a lake or river.
- Gas vent requires filtration media to destroy any gases.
- Burner now cannot destroy items and instead generates heat.
- Tailings pond is moved from automation science to pY science pack 3
- Prevented the "dump" hotkey on pipes and fluid tanks (exceptions: water, steam)
- Shooting chests will now spill their contents on the floor instead of being destroyed
- Added tons of new recycling recipes to reprocess the following junk byproducts:

```purest nitrogen, chlorine, limestone, sulfur, muddy sludge, tailings dust, coal gas, slacked lime, skin, bonemeal, guts, wastewater, yaedols spores, used comb, arthropod blood, chitin, sodium hydroxide, flue gas, vanadium pulp stage 3, titanium overflow waste, titanium pulp (stage 3), purex concentrate 1, antimony phosphate 2, plutonium isotopes, sand, medium disilates, creosote, refined natural gas, anthracene oil, residual oil, naphtha, gasolene, cumeme, methanol, coke oven gas, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, acetone, carbolic oil, bones, fluorine gas, residual-gas, msa acid, shells, tar, oxygen, pressurized air, vacuum, pressurized water, used control rods, oleochemicals```

### Heat Management

- Several machines have been changed to require heat. This includes incubator, regenerative heat exchanger, simik den, multipurpose cracker, advanced foundry, and the heavy oil refinery
- Heat can be generated via burning biomass in burners, burning coal in a coal powerplant, or RTG
- Vanilla nuclear reactor is renamed to "breeder reactor". It generates waste heat that must be removed.
- Heat pipes have a decay of 2°C per tile

### Logistics

- Moving stuff around is more difficult. Will require more planning and infrastructure
- Chests, sheds, storehouses, warehouses, and deposits have a much smaller inventory size
- Logistic station energy use increased from 10MW -> 200MW
- Logistic bots have a lower stack size
- Resource rocks now have collision and have infinite richness. Say goodbye to your city blocks and main busses

Loaders have been added 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘤𝘰𝘴𝘵...

### Biomass

- This includes `spores, sap, seaweed, moss, and fawogae`
- Composting of certain animal parts is no longer allowed

### pYAL Creatures

Several pYAL creatures are optional or only have uses far after they are unlocked. This mod makes these optional creatures more relevant.

- Zipirs & guar gum added to military science
- Cadaveric arum seeds are now required for electrolytic capacitors
- Mukmouxes are required for chemical science
- Gas bladders added to pY science pack 3
- Adult dhilmos added to arqad propolis
- Shells added to primers

### Other

- Removed moss+seaweed chelator recipe
- Electric arc furnace energy usage greatly increased
- Acetylene fuel value nerfed by 25%
- Coke oven gas fuel value nerfed by 25%
- Stone requires carbolic oil as a mining fluid
- Copper requires water as a mining fluid
- Arum farming will generate residual gas
- Added underflow and overflow valves to your starting items
- Removed fuel value from residual gas, residual mixture, and residual oil. Find another way to get rid of these byproducts.
- Vatbrains nerfed from 25%/tier to 15%/tier
- Ash requirement for planter boxes increased 3 -> 9.
- Reworked neutron absorbers & plutonium chain.
- Raw coal & coal dust fuel value nerfed 50%
- Pyrrhic victory requires first researching all the other space science techs.
- Space science is more expensive.
- Added nexelit-titanium-kevlar-aramid-tritium-unobtanium superpolymer nanowoven biocomposite smart self-healing quantum 6 dimensional hyperfabric
- Added a nice cozy sweater

### Recommended 3rd party mods
- Recipe browser such as [FNEI](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FNEI) or [Recipe Book](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RecipeBook)
- Ratio calculator such as [Factory Planner](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factoryplanner), [Helmod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/helmod), or [YAFC](https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/yafc)
- pYHM includes [AAI loaders](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-loaders) by default. Additional loader mods are not required.
- Use of [Resource Spawner Overhaul (RSO)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/rso-mod) is NOT recommended.
It will cause certain resources such as geothermal vents to be extremely common.
Instead try the in-game Pyanodon preset from the world generation menu.
- It also works with [Pyblock](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PyBlock)
